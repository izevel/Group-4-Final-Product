        <h2 style="color: #002b5b;">What is Systemic Inflammation?</h2>
        <p>
            Systemic inflammation is a widespread immune response that extends beyond a localized injury or infection, 
            affecting the entire body. It is a complex process that begins with the activation of the immune system to defend 
            against potential threats like infections, injuries, or autoimmune triggers. While inflammation is essential for 
            healing, when it becomes excessive or prolonged, it can lead to serious health complications, including tissue 
            damage and organ dysfunction.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 style="color: #002b5b;">How Does It Start?</h2>
        <p>
            Systemic inflammation often begins as a localized response. At the site of injury or infection, immune cells 
            release signaling molecules called cytokines. These cytokines coordinate the immune defense, attracting more 
            immune cells to the area and amplifying the response. However, in certain situations, these inflammatory signals 
            spill into the bloodstream, triggering a body-wide reaction. This escalation can lead to a phenomenon known as a 
            cytokine storm, where inflammation spirals out of control.

    <section>
        <h2 style="color: #002b5b;">Symptoms of Systemic Inflammation</h2>
        <p>
            Systemic inflammation manifests through a combination of localized and body-wide symptoms:

            Early Signs: Redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which reflect the localized immune response.
            Body-wide Symptoms: Fever, fatigue, muscle aches, and cardiovascular changes like low blood pressure or 
            rapid heart rate. If severe, this can escalate to shock or organ dysfunction.

            In cases where inflammation persists without resolution, it may evolve into chronic inflammation, contributing 
            to long-term health problems.

        <h2 style="color: #002b5b;">Why Biomarkers Matter</h2>
        <p>
            Tracking systemic inflammation requires precise tools. Biomarkers are molecules that provide valuable insights 
            into the immune system's activity during an inflammatory response. Four critical biomarkers—IL-6, IL-1, TNF-alpha, 
            and CRP—play distinct roles in understanding and monitoring the condition:

            Cytokines (IL-6, IL-1, TNF-alpha): These signaling molecules initiate and regulate inflammation.
            C-reactive protein (CRP): Produced by the liver in response to cytokine activity, CRP is a key indicator of 
            systemic inflammation and is widely used in clinical practice.

            By monitoring these biomarkers, healthcare providers can assess the severity of inflammation and guide treatment 
            strategies to prevent complications.

        <h2 style="color: #002b5b;">Why Systemmic Inflammation Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Unchecked systemic inflammation can result in severe acute conditions or contribute to chronic diseases 
            like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders. Understanding the mechanisms of inflammation 
            and its biomarkers is a crucial step in early diagnosis, effective treatment, and improving long-term health 
            outcomes.
