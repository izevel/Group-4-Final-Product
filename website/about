            <h2>What is Systemic Inflammation?</h2>
            <p>
                Systemic inflammation is a widespread immune response that extends beyond a localized injury or infection, 
                affecting the entire body. While essential for healing, excessive or prolonged inflammation can cause 
                serious health complications.

        <section id="causes">
            <h2>How Does It Start?</h2>
            <p>
                Systemic inflammation often begins as a localized response where immune cells release cytokines to 
                coordinate defense. If these signals enter the bloodstream, a body-wide reaction may occur, sometimes 
                escalating into a cytokine storm.

        <section id="symptoms">
            <h2>Symptoms of Systemic Inflammation</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Localized Signs:</strong> Redness, swelling, heat, and pain.<br>
                <strong>Body-wide Symptoms:</strong> Fever, fatigue, muscle aches, and cardiovascular changes, which may 
                escalate to organ dysfunction or shock in severe cases.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="biomarkers">
            <h2>Why Biomarkers Matter</h2>
            <p>
                Biomarkers like IL-6, IL-1, TNF-alpha, and CRP help monitor inflammation. Cytokines initiate and regulate 
                immune responses, while CRP, produced by the liver, is a critical clinical indicator of systemic inflammation.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="importance">
            <h2>Why Systemic Inflammation Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Unchecked inflammation can lead to severe acute conditions or contribute to chronic diseases like 
                cardiovascular disorders. Understanding its mechanisms and biomarkers enables early diagnosis, effective 
                treatment, and better health outcomes.
