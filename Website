        <h2 style="color: #002b5b;">Welcome to the Inflammatory Response and Systemic Infections Research Portal</h2>
        <p>
            The immune system is a complex and remarkable defense mechanism that protects our body from infections and injuries. 
            This platform delves into the genes and molecular pathways associated with inflammatory responses in systemic infections, 
            providing a gateway to better understand these critical biological processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through interactive visualizations and detailed analysis, we aim to uncover key biomarkers and pathways involved in 
            systemic inflammation, with applications in medical research, diagnostics, and therapeutic advancements.

    <section id="about" style="padding: 20px; max-width: 900px; margin: 30px auto;">
        <h2 style="color: #002b5b;">About</h2>
        <p>
            This research project investigates genes associated with inflammatory responses in systemic infections by utilizing 
            cutting-edge bioinformatics tools and datasets. Our methods include:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li><strong>WikiPathways SPARQL Endpoint:</strong> For querying molecular pathways relevant to inflammation.</li>
            <li><strong>DisGeNet:</strong> A comprehensive platform for identifying gene-disease associations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Data visualization is performed using **Cytoscape.js**, a powerful JavaScript library, enabling researchers to 
            explore relationships between genes, pathways, and diseases interactively.

        <h3 style="color: #002b5b;">What are Inflammatory Responses?</h3>
        <p>
            Inflammatory responses occur when tissues are injured by bacteria, trauma, toxins, or other factors. 
            Damaged cells release chemicals such as histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandins, leading to fluid accumulation 
            and swelling. This process is critical for defense and tissue repair but can become harmful if unregulated.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: #002b5b;">What are Systemic Infections?</h3>
        <p>
            Systemic infections arise when pathogens spread into the bloodstream, affecting multiple organs and systems. 
            These infections often trigger widespread inflammation, which can lead to severe health complications like sepsis.

        <h2 style="color: #002b5b;">Key Biomarkers</h2>
        <p>
            Inflammatory biomarkers play a crucial role in understanding the body's response to infections and injuries. 
            The following molecules are essential in systemic inflammation:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li><strong>CRP (C-reactive protein):</strong> An acute-phase protein produced by the liver in response to cytokines like IL-6, often measured in systemic inflammation.</li>
            <li><strong>IL-6 (Interleukin-6):</strong> A cytokine that mediates fever and the acute-phase inflammatory response.</li>
            <li><strong>TNF-alpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha):</strong> A cytokine that regulates immune responses and triggers inflammation.</li>
            <li><strong>IL-1 (Interleukin-1):</strong> Initiates the inflammatory cascade and promotes the production of other cytokines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These biomarkers are elevated in conditions like sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune disorders. 
            Understanding their roles can aid in developing targeted therapies for inflammatory diseases.
