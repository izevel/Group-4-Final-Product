# Group-4-Final-Product

This repository contains resources for a web-based project related to biomarkers and inflammatory pathways. The primary focus is on visualizing key signaling pathways involved in inflammation, such as CRP (C-reactive protein), IL-1, IL-6, and TNF. These visualizations help in understanding the role of these biomarkers in various physiological and disease processes.

The project is built with a simple HTML, CSS, and image-based structure. It includes an informative website that presents these pathways alongside their respective images. The website is styled with custom CSS to ensure an engaging and clean user experience.

## Features:
- **Biomarker Pathways**: Visual representations of inflammatory pathways like CRP, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF.
- **Responsive Website**: Basic HTML and CSS layout for presenting the pathways and relevant content.
- **Images**: High-quality pathway diagrams to visualize the biological processes.

## Project Structure:
- **Images**: Contains images for various inflammatory pathways (e.g., CRP, IL1, IL6, TNF).
- **Website**: Contains HTML and CSS files for the website layout and design.
