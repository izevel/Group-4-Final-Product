This repository contains resources for a web-based project related to biomarkers and inflammatory pathways. The primary focus is on visualizing key signaling pathways involved in inflammation, such as CRP (C-reactive protein), IL-1, IL-6, and TNF. These visualizations help in understanding the role of these biomarkers in various physiological and disease processes.

The project is built with a simple HTML, CSS, and image-based structure. It includes an informative website that presents these pathways alongside their respective images. The website is styled with custom CSS to ensure an engaging and clean user experience.
